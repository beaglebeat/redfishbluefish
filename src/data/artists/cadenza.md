Dear Diary,

It's been such a fun start for us so far. Last fall, we got to play in so many shows! It's been great so far, but we can't wait to welcome back Mattan from Hawaii and really kick things into gear -- tech school pun, haha! Thanks, Diary, you always laugh at my jokes.

Despite the trials and tribulations, we've only become more self-assured about who we are as a band and our vision is clearer than ever. We have BIG plans for this year: new songs, more videos, and maybe even a trumpet player? Who knows... it's almost like we can do anything.

Sincerely,

The band currently and formerly known as Cadenza
